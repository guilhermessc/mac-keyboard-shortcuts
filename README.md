# How to use

First, make sure to have `yabai` and `skhd` installed and running. To do so, you can follow the instructions on this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL1lz77YbUE) (No need to disable SIP).

Then download all the files of this repository in `~/.config/skhd/`. Note: if you have an old `skhdrc` file replace by this one.

**PRO Tip**: Use the following commands to have the git repo in the right place and pull the updates.

```
# Go to the right directory and clone it
$ cd ~/.config/skhd/
$ git clone git@github.com:guilhermessc/mac-keyboard-shortcuts.git .

# Pull for updates
$ git pull
```

To make sure everything is working you can just execute the python scripts from your terminal.

Enjoy!
