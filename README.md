# How to use

First, make sure to have `yabai` and `skhd` installed and running. To do so, you can follow the instructions on this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL1lz77YbUE) (No need to disable SIP).

Then move all the files in this repository to `~/.config/skhd/`. Note: if you have an old `skhdrc` file replace by this one.

To make sure everything is working you can just execute the python scripts from your terminal.

Enjoy!
